# FIFA-20-Player-Analysis-Clustering
Performed exploratory data analysis on FIFA 20 dataset to uncover insights into player performance, age distribution, and country-wise representation.

Clustered players based on attributes (speed, dribbling, passing, strength) using unsupervised learning to identify similar playing styles.

Analyzed offensive player positions (ST, RW, LW) to determine salary and performance trends; visualized career progression of players.
